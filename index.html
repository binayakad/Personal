		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>My name is Binayak Adhikari, and I am a computer engineer based Inaruwa. I have always been interested in technology, and after graduating from college with a degree in Computer Science, I pursued a career in computer science development.

            <p>Throughout my career, I have worked on various projects, ranging from network engineer  to designing web applications. I have also had the opportunity to work with a diverse group of individuals, which has allowed me to develop my communication and problem-solving skills.</p>
            
            <p>In addition to my work in software development, I am also passionate about giving back to the community. I volunteer at a local non-profit organization that provides computer training to underprivileged youth. Through this experience, I have been able to inspire and mentor young people to pursue careers in technology.</p>
            
           <p> When I'm not working, I enjoy spending time outdoors, hiking, and exploring new places. I also love to read and stay up-to-date with the latest technology trends and innovations.</p>
